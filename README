Hey hopefully Mr. Cop. This is a compilation of 4 of my commisions that I have used for various strange reasons. Unfortunately I don't give a fuck
enough to import all of the images and shit that compiles the gui together so ill just leave gyazo screenshots here. Please keep in mind that im a python
developer so frontend dev is at the back of my mind (no pun intended). Please consider me a real applicant because im not joking when I say this: I will
learn css, javascript, and html if it means even getting a whif of working with the renound Senior Cop. Below I will leave some gyazo screenshots of all
of the python filed I have put in this project.
Also keep in mind that these are mostly single tab programs because I have never needed multiple tabs but that is something I am capable of creating.



SCREENSHOTS 

TitanAIO (Im a keep it a buck witchu this is the most visually displeasing thing Ive seen but my job is putting the images together not making drawing)

Chicago Transit Authority API use (If you read through the descriptions of the python projects which I reccomend you should you would know that I imported this file
from an earlier version of python so it got kinda fucked. If for some strange reason this is the dealbreaker I can make it look prettier for you but this is more
of a proof of concept to show that I can work with external APIs. This is also something that prints through the console of my IDE so I will show two screenshots.
